# Model Training Guide

This guide explains how to set up the environment and train the HSTU/DLRM models on Cloud TPU v6.

## Option 1: Virtual Environment (Recommended for Dev)

If you are developing on a TPU VM directly, use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with the system-level Python packages.

#### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.11+** installed.
```bash
python3 --version
```

### 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
Run the following from the root of the repository:
```bash
# Create the venv
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We need to force a specific version of Protobuf to ensure compatibility with our TPU stack. Run this exactly as shown:
```bash
pip install "protobuf>=6.31.1" --no-deps
```
The `--no-deps` flag is required to prevent pip from downgrading it due to strict dependency pinning in other libraries.

### 4. Run the Training for DLRM
```bash
python dlrm_experiment_test.py
```

## Option 2: Docker (Recommended for Production)

If you prefer not to manage a virtual environment or want to deploy this as a container, you can build a Docker image.

## 1. Build the Image
Create a file named `Dockerfile` in the root of the repository:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python 3.11 runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install system tools if needed (e.g., git)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Force install the specific protobuf version
RUN pip install "protobuf>=6.31.1" --no-deps

# Default command to run the training script
CMD ["python", "recml/examples/dlrm_experiment_test.py"]
```

You can use this dockerfile to run the DLRM model experiment from this repo in your own environment.
